        # Fluency uses java.nio.ByteBuffer which can cause inconsistent method signature issue between JDK 8 and 9.
        # We've created Fluency jars using JDK 8 for that and we need to confirm an application built with JDK 9 or later
        # can use Fluecy jars built with JDK 8 without any problem.
        # We're using --release option to build source code with JDK 8. So JDK 17 should work here.
